# Priority Queues
This project implemets two basic types of priority queues:
1. MutablePriorityQueues
	* The queue and it's elemets have changeable values.
2. MutablePriorityQueues
	* The queue and it's elemets aren't changeable and have to be recreated with each change.
They each store Elements which have a priority(int) and a atom(string).
The queues are sorted by priority with priority = 1 being the highest.
