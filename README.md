# Priority Queues
This project implemets two basic types of priority queues:
<ol>
	<li>1. MutablePriorityQueues
		<ol>The queue and it's elemets have changeable values.</ol>
	</li>
	<li>2. MutablePriorityQueues
		<ol>The queue and it's elemets aren't changeable and have to be recreated with each change.</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
They each store Elements which have a priority(int) and a atom(string).
The queues are sorted by priority with priority = 1 being the highest.
